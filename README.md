# PiGlow
These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow.
These programs require benleb's Pyglow module (https://github.com/benleb/PyGlow) that I got by following the instructions on this github page: 
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/piglow. 
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs. 

Enjoy.
