# PiGlow
These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow.
These programs require the PyGlow.py program that I got following the instructions on the Raspberry Pi website
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/piglow/requirements/software/
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs.  Enjoy.

# Note
I wrote and tested these out on the Raspberry Pi. I have a Raspberry Pi 2, but haven't test these programs out on it. They'll probably run faster and the times will need to be adjusted.
