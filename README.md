# PiGlow

These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow. There are over 40 of them. They are written in Python 3.
These programs require benleb's Pyglow module (https://github.com/benleb/PyGlow) that I got by following the instructions on this github page: 
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/piglow. The PyGlow module adds some functionality like pulsing which the Pimoroni piglow library didn't have. I included the PyGlow module for your convenience.

Enjoy.
