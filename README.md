# PiGlow
These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow.
These programs require the PyGlow.py program that I got following the instructions on the Raspberry Pi website
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/piglow
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs.  Enjoy.

# Note
I wrote and tested these out on the Raspberry Pi. I have a Raspberry Pi 2, but haven't test these programs out on it yet. They'll probably run faster and the times will need to be adjusted. Once I've tested them on the Raspberry Pi 2 and made any nessary code changes, I will put them in a folder called "Raspberry Pi 2."
