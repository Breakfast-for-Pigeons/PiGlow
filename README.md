# PiGlow
NOTE: I'm currently in the process of updating these programs to Python 3.

These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow. There are over 40 of them.
These programs require benleb's Pyglow module (https://github.com/benleb/PyGlow) that I got by following the instructions on this github page: 
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/piglow. 
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs. 

Enjoy.
