# PiGlow
These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow.
These programs require the PyGlow.py program that I got following the instructions on the Raspberry Pi website
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/piglow/requirements/software/
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs.  Enjoy.

# Note
I wrote and tested these out on the Raspberry Pi. I have a Raspberry Pi 2, but haven't test these programs out on it yet. They'll probably run faster and the times will need to be adjusted. Once I've tested them on the Raspberry Pi 2 and made any nessary code changes, I will put them in a folder called "Raspberry Pi 2." 

# Help
I wrote a couple of programs for the PiGlow that I called "Meteor Shower" and "Meteor Shower with Fireballs" because, well, they remind me of meteor showers. If anyone can write a script so that they run one of the Meteor Shower programs when there are actual meteor showers (the Leonids for example), I think that would be very cool. I found a list of when meteor showers occur at the following website:
