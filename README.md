# PiGlow
These are the programs that I wrote for the PiGlow.
These programs require the PyGlow.py program that I got following the instructions on the Raspberry Pi website
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/piglow 
Once you follow those setup instructions, you can run my programs.  They use benleb's Pyglow module.

Enjoy.
